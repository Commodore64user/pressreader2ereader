Convert PressReader ePubs to friendlier e-reader ePubs

This is mostly a personal project to solve a very specific issue. PressReader allows you to download e-reader "friendly" versions of their Newspapers however, their conversion algorithm will duplicate articles under some circumstances (multi-page spreads), creating thus a highly bloated ePub. This script, iterates through all the articles in the file and discards all the duplicates, creating a much compact and actually friendly ePub to use with your favourite e-reading application.
