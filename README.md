# PressReader ePub Cleaner

A Python script to clean and de-duplicate ePub newspaper files generated by PressReader. It intelligently handles both raw PressReader ePubs and those that have been converted using Calibre, creating a clean, readable file with no duplicate articles or blank pages.

## The Problem

ePubs generated by PressReader often contain duplicated articles. This can happen in two ways:
1.  **Contents Previews**: Articles are printed in full in the "Contents" section at the beginning of the book and then again in their proper section later on.
2.  **Multi-page Spreads**: For articles that span multiple pages in the print edition, the conversion tool repeats the *entire* article for each physical page, for example, if the print version of an articles takes up 3 pages, the digital conversion is printed 3 times in full, back to back.

This script is designed to fix both issues automatically.

## Features

-   Automatically detects the ePub type (Raw PressReader vs. Calibre-converted).
-   Applies a robust rule ("first page of the last consecutive block") to intelligently resolve all duplicates.
-   Correctly removes "Contents" section previews while keeping the real articles. (this is the case, at least for The Economist)
-   Correctly removes multi-page spread duplicates, keeping only one article.
-   Deletes now-empty XHTML files to prevent blank pages in the final ePub.
-   Updates the ePub's master manifest (`content.opf`) and Table of Contents (`toc.ncx`) to reflect the removed pages and prevent errors.
-   Provides a summary of removed articles and deleted pages upon completion.

## Requirements

Note that for The Economist, the new ePub is roughly half the size and  for and The New Yorker, one quarter of the size in terms of page count, broadsheets and tabloids which tend to have fewer multi-page spreads still benefit but slightly less, roughly a 10pc reduction in this case.
